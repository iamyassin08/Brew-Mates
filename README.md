## For example, if you want to create a new Flutter project named "my_flutter_app" in the current directory, you can run:


##command: flutter create my_flutter_app   <-- to get flutter template

##This will create a new Flutter project in a directory named "my_flutter_app" in your current location. Make sure to replace "my_flutter_app" with the desired name for your project.

##cd my_flutter_app
##flutter run
It seems like the Dart SDK version is still not updated to support null safety, despite our efforts to update it. Let's try another approach:

    First, make sure you have Flutter SDK installed on your system.

    Run the following command to switch to a Flutter channel that supports null safety:

flutter channel stable

Then, run the following command to upgrade Flutter:

flutter upgrade

After the upgrade is complete, run the following command to enable null safety for your Flutter project:

css

flutter migrate --apply-changes

This command will migrate your project to null safety. Follow the on-screen instructions if any.

Once the migration is complete, try running your Flutter project again:

arduino

    flutter run

This should resolve the null safety compatibility issue and allow you to run your Flutter project successfully. If you encounter any errors or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
